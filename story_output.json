    "description": "Late afternoon on Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport. Rush hour traffic. Hot and humid. A rickshaw and a car have collided, both drivers blaming each other. Horns honking, crowd gathering. Traffic police known to ask for bribe. Everyone wants this over fast but for different reasons."

Saleem, still gripping the handlebars, stares straight ahead, his knuckles white.

He slowly releases his grip, letting his hands fall to his lap, and then brings them up to cover his face for a moment, a shaky breath escaping his lips. A small, brightly colored toy \u2013 a plastic dinosaur \u2013 has tumbled from the rickshaw\u2019s storage and lies near the crumpled fender.",

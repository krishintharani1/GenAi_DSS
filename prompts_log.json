    "prompt": "You are the Director of a narrative story set in Karachi, Pakistan.\nCurrent Story Context:\nLate afternoon on Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport. Rush hour traffic. Hot and humid. A rickshaw and a car have collided, both drivers blaming each other. Horns honking, crowd gathering. Traffic police known to ask for bribe. Everyone wants this over fast but for different reasons.\n\nRecent Dialogue:\nNo dialogue yet. The story is just starting. Select the character most likely to speak first based on the Context.\n\nRecent Actions:\nNo actions performed yet.\n\nAvailable Characters:\nSaleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nCharacter Secrets (only you know these \u2014 use them to create dramatic irony and tension):\n- Saleem: Has been driving without valid insurance for 6 months because he couldn't afford renewal. The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below.

Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7.

Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4.

Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below.

Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7.

A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4.

When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3.

First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5.

We must determine who is responsible for these repairs immediately.\n\nRecent Actions:\nNo actions performed yet.\n\nAvailable Characters:\nSaleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nCharacter Secrets (only you know these \u2014 use them to create dramatic irony and tension):\n- Saleem: Has been driving without valid insurance for 6 months because he couldn't afford renewal. The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3.

Without involving\u2026 others?\n\nRecent Actions:\nNo actions performed yet.\n\nAvailable Characters:\nSaleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nCharacter Secrets (only you know these \u2014 use them to create dramatic irony and tension):\n- Saleem: Has been driving without valid insurance for 6 months because he couldn't afford renewal. The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

Without involving\u2026 others?\n\n\nCRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:\n1. You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Saleem would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",

Maybe\u2026 maybe we can sort this out between ourselves? Without involving\u2026 others?\n[DIALOGUE] Sahib, bhai, please. I see you are worried about your time. Look, this\u2026 this can be fixed quickly, inshallah. We can talk, just you and me, and come to an understanding. No need for\u2026 paperwork, you understand? I can offer what little I have, but please, let's not delay you further. My family\u2026 they are waiting for me too, yaar.\n\n\nCRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:\n1. You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Saleem would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",

Just\u2026 let\u2019s keep this simple, ya?\n\nRecent Actions:\nNo actions performed yet.\n\nAvailable Characters:\nSaleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nCharacter Secrets (only you know these \u2014 use them to create dramatic irony and tension):\n- Saleem: Has been driving without valid insurance for 6 months because he couldn't afford renewal. The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

Just\u2026 let\u2019s keep this simple, ya?\n\n\nCRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:\n1. You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Saleem would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",

The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

He steps out of his gleaming silver Corolla, carefully avoiding the shards of plastic from Saleem\u2019s rickshaw. He circles the car slowly, examining a long scratch along the driver\u2019s side door. The heat shimmers off the metal. A small crowd is beginning to gather, mostly curious onlookers slowing down to gawk. Saleem continues to plead, his voice rising slightly above the din of honking horns. The air smells of exhaust and dust.\n\nRecent Actions:\nNo actions yet\n\nRecent Dialogue:\nSaleem: Astaghfirullah! Bhai, kya hua? Oh ho\u2026 my back, a little pain.

I require a proper assessment of the damages, and I expect a more reasonable offer to compensate for the disruption to my schedule.\n\n\nCRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:\n1. You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Ahmed Malik would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",

Something that reflects the actual damage and the inconvenience caused. A private settlement, if you will.\n\nRecent Actions:\nNo actions performed yet.\n\nAvailable Characters:\nSaleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nCharacter Secrets (only you know these \u2014 use them to create dramatic irony and tension):\n- Saleem: Has been driving without valid insurance for 6 months because he couldn't afford renewal. The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

A private settlement, if you will.\n\n\nCRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:\n1. You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Ahmed Malik would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",

Otherwise, I will be forced to involve the authorities, and that will be far more troublesome for both of us, wouldn't you agree?\n\nRecent Actions:\nNo actions performed yet.\n\nAvailable Characters:\nSaleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nCharacter Secrets (only you know these \u2014 use them to create dramatic irony and tension):\n- Saleem: Has been driving without valid insurance for 6 months because he couldn't afford renewal. The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

It\u2019s not like I have a business, or savings\u2026 just this rickshaw, and the hope of earning enough to keep my children in school, ya?\n\nRecent Actions:\nNo actions performed yet.\n\nAvailable Characters:\nSaleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nCharacter Secrets (only you know these \u2014 use them to create dramatic irony and tension):\n- Saleem: Has been driving without valid insurance for 6 months because he couldn't afford renewal. The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

It\u2019s not like I have a business, or savings\u2026 just this rickshaw, and the hope of earning enough to keep my children in school, ya?\n\n\nCRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:\n1. You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Saleem would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",

But a large sum\u2026 it will ruin us, bhai.\n\nRecent Actions:\nNo actions performed yet.\n\nAvailable Characters:\nSaleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nCharacter Secrets (only you know these \u2014 use them to create dramatic irony and tension):\n- Saleem: Has been driving without valid insurance for 6 months because he couldn't afford renewal. The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

But a large sum\u2026 it will ruin us, bhai.\n\nYour Previous Lines (DO NOT repeat any gestures, phrases, or mannerisms from these):\n[DIALOGUE] Good heavens. Is anyone seriously injured? This is a complete disruption. Constable, where are you? We need to expedite this matter. I have a flight to catch, and frankly, this entire situation is causing me considerable inconvenience.\n[DIALOGUE] While I sympathize with any discomfort, Constable, are we certain no one has sustained a serious injury?

Otherwise, I will be forced to involve the authorities, and that will be far more troublesome for both of us, wouldn't you agree?\n\n\nCRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:\n1. You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Ahmed Malik would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",

Every moment wasted here jeopardizes a very important arrangement. A more\u2026 comprehensive settlement is required. Otherwise, I will be forced to involve the authorities, and that will be far more troublesome for both of us, wouldn't you agree?\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, you are right, time is valuable. But\u2026 a 'comprehensive settlement'\u2026 that is difficult for a man like me. I barely manage each day, you understand? Where would I find such a large amount so quickly? It\u2019s not like I have a business, or savings\u2026 just this rickshaw, and the hope of earning enough to keep my children in school, ya?\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, look at this rickshaw, yaar. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s completely crippled. The wheel, the frame\u2026 how long will it take to fix? Days? Weeks? And those days\u2026 those are days I can\u2019t earn. Days my children go without. It\u2019s not just about the dent, it\u2019s about my livelihood, you understand? A small amount, yes, I can manage. But a large sum\u2026 it will ruin us, bhai.\nAhmed Malik: Constable, are you quite finished assessing the situation? I must point out that a protracted investigation here will inevitably involve official reports, valuations, and potentially, legal proceedings. All of which will be considerably more expensive \u2013 and time-consuming \u2013 for everyone involved. A swift, amicable resolution is clearly in everyone\u2019s best interest.\n\nRecent Actions:\nNo actions performed yet.\n\nAvailable Characters:\nSaleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nCharacter Secrets (only you know these \u2014 use them to create dramatic irony and tension):\n- Saleem: Has been driving without valid insurance for 6 months because he couldn't afford renewal. The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

But a large sum\u2026 it will ruin us, bhai.\n\n\nCRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:\n1. You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Saleem would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",

He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

Saleem, still shaken, clutches the mangled handlebars of his rickshaw. The front wheel is twisted at an unnatural angle, and the frame groans with each slight movement. A small crowd is beginning to gather, mostly curious onlookers slowing down to gawk. Ahmed Malik stands beside his gleaming sedan, inspecting a barely visible scratch with a look of profound displeasure. He keeps glancing at his watch. The horns of frustrated drivers create a relentless, oppressive drone.\n\nRecent Actions:\nNo actions yet\n\nRecent Dialogue:\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, please. I see you are worried about your time. Look, this\u2026 this can be fixed quickly, inshallah. We can talk, just you and me, and come to an understanding. No need for\u2026 paperwork, you understand? I can offer what little I have, but please, let's not delay you further. My family\u2026 they are waiting for me too, yaar.\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, please listen. I\u2026 I have a little money here. Five hundred rupees. It\u2019s all I have right now, truly. Maybe\u2026 maybe this can help with some of the small damage? I really don\u2019t want any trouble, bhai. Just\u2026 let\u2019s keep this simple, ya?\nAhmed Malik: Five hundred rupees? With all due respect, that barely covers the cost of the paintwork. This is a relatively new vehicle, and the damage is quite visible. I am not interested in a 'simple' solution. I require a proper assessment of the damages, and I expect a more reasonable offer to compensate for the disruption to my schedule.\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, look\u2026 I truly am sorry for this. It\u2019s a disaster for me, you understand? This rickshaw\u2026 it\u2019s not just metal, it\u2019s everything. I was hoping we could find a way to handle this quickly, without\u2026 well, without making things more complicated than they need to be. A lot of paperwork, the police\u2026 it takes time, you know? And time is money for both of us, ya?\nAhmed Malik: Look, I appreciate your\u2026 eagerness to resolve this quickly. However, five hundred rupees is simply not a realistic offer. I am missing a crucial business meeting, and the disruption is costing me considerably more than that. Perhaps we can discuss a more\u2026 substantial arrangement. Something that reflects the actual damage and the inconvenience caused. A private settlement, if you will.\nAhmed Malik: You misunderstand. This isn't simply about the dent, it's about the principle. And the time. Every moment wasted here jeopardizes a very important arrangement. A more\u2026 comprehensive settlement is required. Otherwise, I will be forced to involve the authorities, and that will be far more troublesome for both of us, wouldn't you agree?\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, you are right, time is valuable. But\u2026 a 'comprehensive settlement'\u2026 that is difficult for a man like me. I barely manage each day, you understand? Where would I find such a large amount so quickly?

Days my children go without. It\u2019s not just about the dent, it\u2019s about my livelihood, you understand? A small amount, yes, I can manage. But a large sum\u2026 it will ruin us, bhai.\nAhmed Malik: Constable, are you quite finished assessing the situation? I must point out that a protracted investigation here will inevitably involve official reports, valuations, and potentially, legal proceedings. All of which will be considerably more expensive \u2013 and time-consuming \u2013 for everyone involved. A swift, amicable resolution is clearly in everyone\u2019s best interest.\nSaleem: Constable Sahib, bhai, with all respect\u2026 this is a very difficult situation for me.

I am a poor man, yaar, just trying to earn an honest living.\n\n\nCRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:\n1. You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Saleem would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",

Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

Speaking formally but stressed about missing flight and damage to his car.\n\nYOUR SECRET (only you know this \u2014 it shapes your behavior but you must NOT reveal it directly):\nThe 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\nThis secret should subtly influence your choices, your urgency, your anxiety, and how you react \nto pressure \u2014 but you should NEVER state it out loud. Let it leak through your behavior, not your words.\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\nInitial Event: Late afternoon on Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport. Rush hour traffic. Hot and humid. A rickshaw and a car have collided, both drivers blaming each other. Horns honking, crowd gathering. Traffic police known to ask for bribe. Everyone wants this over fast but for different reasons.\n\nURGENT REQUIREMENT: The story still needs at least 5 more non-verbal actions \n(such as GIVE, LEAVE, CALL, THREATEN, SEARCH, TAKE, SHOW, GESTURE, MOVE) before it can conclude.\nOnly 8 turns remain. You MUST perform a non-verbal action this turn instead of just talking.\nPick an action that makes sense for your character and the current situation.\nYou have these items you could use: iPhone 15 Pro, Rolex watch, Business class ticket to Dubai, Designer leather briefcase, Rs. 50,000 in wallet\n\nWorld State:\nLocation: Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport\nCharacters Present: Saleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nYour Memory:\nInventory (items you physically have on you right now): \n  - iPhone 15 Pro\n  - Rolex watch\n  - Business class ticket to Dubai\n  - Designer leather briefcase\n  - Rs. 50,000 in wallet\nGoals: None\nImportant Facts You Know: SECRET: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\nRecent Observations: I said: While I sympathize with any discomfort, Constable, are we certain no one has sustained a serious injury? Regardless, the damage to my vehicle is quite substantial. A brand new Corolla, you understand. This delay is\u2026 deeply problematic. We must determine who is responsible for these repairs immediately.; I said: Five hundred rupees? With all due respect, that barely covers the cost of the paintwork. This is a relatively new vehicle, and the damage is quite visible. I am not interested in a 'simple' solution. I require a proper assessment of the damages, and I expect a more reasonable offer to compensate for the disruption to my schedule.; I said: Look, I appreciate your\u2026 eagerness to resolve this quickly. However, five hundred rupees is simply not a realistic offer. I am missing a crucial business meeting, and the disruption is costing me considerably more than that. Perhaps we can discuss a more\u2026 substantial arrangement. Something that reflects the actual damage and the inconvenience caused. A private settlement, if you will.; I said: You misunderstand. This isn't simply about the dent, it's about the principle. And the time. Every moment wasted here jeopardizes a very important arrangement. A more\u2026 comprehensive settlement is required. Otherwise, I will be forced to involve the authorities, and that will be far more troublesome for both of us, wouldn't you agree?; I said: Constable, are you quite finished assessing the situation? I must point out that a protracted investigation here will inevitably involve official reports, valuations, and potentially, legal proceedings.

Ahmed Malik, impeccably dressed in a light linen suit despite the heat, carefully steps out of his silver Corolla.

I\u2026 I have a little money here. Five hundred rupees. It\u2019s all I have right now, truly. Maybe\u2026 maybe this can help with some of the small damage? I really don\u2019t want any trouble, bhai. Just\u2026 let\u2019s keep this simple, ya?\nAhmed Malik: Five hundred rupees? With all due respect, that barely covers the cost of the paintwork. This is a relatively new vehicle, and the damage is quite visible. I am not interested in a 'simple' solution. I require a proper assessment of the damages, and I expect a more reasonable offer to compensate for the disruption to my schedule.\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, look\u2026 I truly am sorry for this. It\u2019s a disaster for me, you understand? This rickshaw\u2026 it\u2019s not just metal, it\u2019s everything. I was hoping we could find a way to handle this quickly, without\u2026 well, without making things more complicated than they need to be. A lot of paperwork, the police\u2026 it takes time, you know? And time is money for both of us, ya?\nAhmed Malik: Look, I appreciate your\u2026 eagerness to resolve this quickly. However, five hundred rupees is simply not a realistic offer.

But\u2026 a 'comprehensive settlement'\u2026 that is difficult for a man like me. I barely manage each day, you understand? Where would I find such a large amount so quickly? It\u2019s not like I have a business, or savings\u2026 just this rickshaw, and the hope of earning enough to keep my children in school, ya?\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, look at this rickshaw, yaar. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s completely crippled. The wheel, the frame\u2026 how long will it take to fix? Days? Weeks? And those days\u2026 those are days I can\u2019t earn. Days my children go without. It\u2019s not just about the dent, it\u2019s about my livelihood, you understand? A small amount, yes, I can manage. But a large sum\u2026 it will ruin us, bhai.\nAhmed Malik: Constable, are you quite finished assessing the situation? I must point out that a protracted investigation here will inevitably involve official reports, valuations, and potentially, legal proceedings. All of which will be considerably more expensive \u2013 and time-consuming \u2013 for everyone involved. A swift, amicable resolution is clearly in everyone\u2019s best interest.\nSaleem: Constable Sahib, bhai, with all respect\u2026 this is a very difficult situation for me. This rickshaw\u2026 it\u2019s how I feed my family. A large fine, or a big payment\u2026 it will be a real struggle. Is there\u2026 is there no way to consider the circumstances? I am a poor man, yaar, just trying to earn an honest living.\nSaleem: Constable Sahib, bhai, this\u2026 this repair, it will cost a lot, yes? Even for just the wheel and the frame. Do you think\u2026 is there a good mechanic nearby who might give a little discount? A man has to try, ya? Maybe if we could find someone reasonable, it wouldn\u2019t be such a\u2026 a heavy burden.\n\nYour Previous Lines (DO NOT repeat any gestures, phrases, or mannerisms from these):\n[DIALOGUE] While I sympathize with any discomfort, Constable, are we certain no one has sustained a serious injury?

All of which will be considerably more expensive \u2013 and time-consuming \u2013 for everyone involved. A swift, amicable resolution is clearly in everyone\u2019s best interest.\n\n\nCRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:\n1. You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Ahmed Malik would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",

He doesn't offer it, simply showcases it while maintaining eye contact.\n\nAvailable Characters:\nSaleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nCharacter Secrets (only you know these \u2014 use them to create dramatic irony and tension):\n- Saleem: Has been driving without valid insurance for 6 months because he couldn't afford renewal. The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

Speaking formally but stressed about missing flight and damage to his car.\n\nYOUR SECRET (only you know this \u2014 it shapes your behavior but you must NOT reveal it directly):\nThe 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\nThis secret should subtly influence your choices, your urgency, your anxiety, and how you react \nto pressure \u2014 but you should NEVER state it out loud. Let it leak through your behavior, not your words.\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\nInitial Event: Late afternoon on Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport. Rush hour traffic. Hot and humid. A rickshaw and a car have collided, both drivers blaming each other. Horns honking, crowd gathering. Traffic police known to ask for bribe. Everyone wants this over fast but for different reasons.\n\nURGENT REQUIREMENT: The story still needs at least 4 more non-verbal actions \n(such as GIVE, LEAVE, CALL, THREATEN, SEARCH, TAKE, SHOW, GESTURE, MOVE) before it can conclude.\nOnly 7 turns remain. You MUST perform a non-verbal action this turn instead of just talking.\nPick an action that makes sense for your character and the current situation.\nYou have these items you could use: iPhone 15 Pro, Rolex watch, Business class ticket to Dubai, Designer leather briefcase, Rs. 50,000 in wallet\n\nWorld State:\nLocation: Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport\nCharacters Present: Saleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nYour Memory:\nInventory (items you physically have on you right now): \n  - iPhone 15 Pro\n  - Rolex watch\n  - Business class ticket to Dubai\n  - Designer leather briefcase\n  - Rs. 50,000 in wallet\nGoals: None\nImportant Facts You Know: SECRET: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud.

This is a relatively new vehicle, and the damage is quite visible. I am not interested in a 'simple' solution. I require a proper assessment of the damages, and I expect a more reasonable offer to compensate for the disruption to my schedule.; I said: Look, I appreciate your\u2026 eagerness to resolve this quickly. However, five hundred rupees is simply not a realistic offer. I am missing a crucial business meeting, and the disruption is costing me considerably more than that. Perhaps we can discuss a more\u2026 substantial arrangement. Something that reflects the actual damage and the inconvenience caused. A private settlement, if you will.; I said: You misunderstand. This isn't simply about the dent, it's about the principle. And the time. Every moment wasted here jeopardizes a very important arrangement. A more\u2026 comprehensive settlement is required.

He doesn't offer it, simply showcases it while maintaining eye contact.\nPerceptions of Others: None yet\n\nDirector Narration: The heat shimmers off the asphalt, intensifying the already oppressive humidity. A small crowd has begun to gather, mostly curious onlookers craning their necks to get a better view of the damage. The horns continue to blare, a discordant symphony of Karachi rush hour. Ahmed Malik, impeccably dressed despite the circumstances, adjusts his tie and surveys the scene with barely concealed impatience. He glances at his watch again, a subtle but pointed gesture. Constable Raza is still a distant figure, approaching slowly through the gridlock, looking more interested in scanning the crowd than assessing the accident.\n\nRecent Actions:\n[ACTION] Ahmed Malik: Ahmed Malik smoothly removes his Rolex watch, turning his wrist slightly to catch the sunlight and display the timepiece to Constable Raza.

This is a relatively new vehicle, and the damage is quite visible. I am not interested in a 'simple' solution. I require a proper assessment of the damages, and I expect a more reasonable offer to compensate for the disruption to my schedule.\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, look\u2026 I truly am sorry for this. It\u2019s a disaster for me, you understand? This rickshaw\u2026 it\u2019s not just metal, it\u2019s everything. I was hoping we could find a way to handle this quickly, without\u2026 well, without making things more complicated than they need to be. A lot of paperwork, the police\u2026 it takes time, you know? And time is money for both of us, ya?\nAhmed Malik: Look, I appreciate your\u2026 eagerness to resolve this quickly. However, five hundred rupees is simply not a realistic offer.

But\u2026 a 'comprehensive settlement'\u2026 that is difficult for a man like me. I barely manage each day, you understand? Where would I find such a large amount so quickly? It\u2019s not like I have a business, or savings\u2026 just this rickshaw, and the hope of earning enough to keep my children in school, ya?\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, look at this rickshaw, yaar. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s completely crippled. The wheel, the frame\u2026 how long will it take to fix? Days? Weeks? And those days\u2026 those are days I can\u2019t earn. Days my children go without. It\u2019s not just about the dent, it\u2019s about my livelihood, you understand? A small amount, yes, I can manage. But a large sum\u2026 it will ruin us, bhai.\nAhmed Malik: Constable, are you quite finished assessing the situation? I must point out that a protracted investigation here will inevitably involve official reports, valuations, and potentially, legal proceedings. All of which will be considerably more expensive \u2013 and time-consuming \u2013 for everyone involved. A swift, amicable resolution is clearly in everyone\u2019s best interest.\nSaleem: Constable Sahib, bhai, with all respect\u2026 this is a very difficult situation for me. This rickshaw\u2026 it\u2019s how I feed my family. A large fine, or a big payment\u2026 it will be a real struggle. Is there\u2026 is there no way to consider the circumstances? I am a poor man, yaar, just trying to earn an honest living.\nSaleem: Constable Sahib, bhai, this\u2026 this repair, it will cost a lot, yes? Even for just the wheel and the frame. Do you think\u2026 is there a good mechanic nearby who might give a little discount? A man has to try, ya?

He doesn't offer it, simply showcases it while maintaining eye contact.\n\n\nCRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:\n1. You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Ahmed Malik would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",

The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

It\u2019s not like I have a business, or savings\u2026 just this rickshaw, and the hope of earning enough to keep my children in school, ya?; I said: Sahib, bhai, look at this rickshaw, yaar. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s completely crippled. The wheel, the frame\u2026 how long will it take to fix? Days? Weeks? And those days\u2026 those are days I can\u2019t earn. Days my children go without. It\u2019s not just about the dent, it\u2019s about my livelihood, you understand? A small amount, yes, I can manage. But a large sum\u2026 it will ruin us, bhai.; I said: Constable Sahib, bhai, with all respect\u2026 this is a very difficult situation for me. This rickshaw\u2026 it\u2019s how I feed my family.

Maybe if we could find someone reasonable, it wouldn\u2019t be such a\u2026 a heavy burden.\nPerceptions of Others: None yet\n\nDirector Narration: The metallic scent of gasoline hangs in the humid air. Saleem stares at the crumpled front wheel of his rickshaw, his hands trembling. A small crowd has begun to gather, mostly curious onlookers craning their necks. Ahmed Malik stands rigidly beside his gleaming silver car, seemingly unconcerned with the chaos. The afternoon sun beats down, intensifying the heat radiating from the asphalt. Saleem glances at Ahmed Malik, then back at his ruined wheel, a desperate plea forming on his lips.\n\nRecent Actions:\n[ACTION] Ahmed Malik: Ahmed Malik smoothly removes his Rolex watch, turning his wrist slightly to catch the sunlight and display the timepiece to Constable Raza. He doesn't offer it, simply showcases it while maintaining eye contact.\n[ACTION] Ahmed Malik: Ahmed Malik swiftly takes out his iPhone 15 Pro and begins to dial, holding it to his ear. He speaks in a clipped, urgent tone, turning slightly away from Saleem and Constable Raza. 'Yes, yes\u2026 confirm the arrangements for the Dubai meeting. Absolutely critical I arrive on schedule. Any change will be\u2026 unacceptable.'\n\nRecent Dialogue:\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, please listen. I\u2026 I have a little money here. Five hundred rupees. It\u2019s all I have right now, truly. Maybe\u2026 maybe this can help with some of the small damage? I really don\u2019t want any trouble, bhai. Just\u2026 let\u2019s keep this simple, ya?\nAhmed Malik: Five hundred rupees? With all due respect, that barely covers the cost of the paintwork. This is a relatively new vehicle, and the damage is quite visible. I am not interested in a 'simple' solution. I require a proper assessment of the damages, and I expect a more reasonable offer to compensate for the disruption to my schedule.\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, look\u2026 I truly am sorry for this. It\u2019s a disaster for me, you understand? This rickshaw\u2026 it\u2019s not just metal, it\u2019s everything. I was hoping we could find a way to handle this quickly, without\u2026 well, without making things more complicated than they need to be. A lot of paperwork, the police\u2026 it takes time, you know? And time is money for both of us, ya?\nAhmed Malik: Look, I appreciate your\u2026 eagerness to resolve this quickly. However, five hundred rupees is simply not a realistic offer. I am missing a crucial business meeting, and the disruption is costing me considerably more than that. Perhaps we can discuss a more\u2026 substantial arrangement. Something that reflects the actual damage and the inconvenience caused. A private settlement, if you will.\nAhmed Malik: You misunderstand. This isn't simply about the dent, it's about the principle. And the time. Every moment wasted here jeopardizes a very important arrangement. A more\u2026 comprehensive settlement is required. Otherwise, I will be forced to involve the authorities, and that will be far more troublesome for both of us, wouldn't you agree?\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, you are right, time is valuable. But\u2026 a 'comprehensive settlement'\u2026 that is difficult for a man like me. I barely manage each day, you understand? Where would I find such a large amount so quickly?

But a large sum\u2026 it will ruin us, bhai.\nAhmed Malik: Constable, are you quite finished assessing the situation? I must point out that a protracted investigation here will inevitably involve official reports, valuations, and potentially, legal proceedings. All of which will be considerably more expensive \u2013 and time-consuming \u2013 for everyone involved.

You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Saleem would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",

The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

A rickshaw and a car have collided, both drivers blaming each other. Horns honking, crowd gathering. Traffic police known to ask for bribe. Everyone wants this over fast but for different reasons.\n\nURGENT REQUIREMENT: The story still needs at least 2 more non-verbal actions \n(such as GIVE, LEAVE, CALL, THREATEN, SEARCH, TAKE, SHOW, GESTURE, MOVE) before it can conclude.\nOnly 5 turns remain. You MUST perform a non-verbal action this turn instead of just talking.\nPick an action that makes sense for your character and the current situation.\nYou have these items you could use: iPhone 15 Pro, Rolex watch, Business class ticket to Dubai, Designer leather briefcase, Rs. 50,000 in wallet\n\nWorld State:\nLocation: Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport\nCharacters Present: Saleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nYour Memory:\nInventory (items you physically have on you right now): \n  - iPhone 15 Pro\n  - Rolex watch\n  - Business class ticket to Dubai\n  - Designer leather briefcase\n  - Rs. 50,000 in wallet\nGoals: None\nImportant Facts You Know: SECRET: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\nRecent Observations: I said: Look, I appreciate your\u2026 eagerness to resolve this quickly. However, five hundred rupees is simply not a realistic offer. I am missing a crucial business meeting, and the disruption is costing me considerably more than that. Perhaps we can discuss a more\u2026 substantial arrangement. Something that reflects the actual damage and the inconvenience caused. A private settlement, if you will.; I said: You misunderstand. This isn't simply about the dent, it's about the principle. And the time. Every moment wasted here jeopardizes a very important arrangement. A more\u2026 comprehensive settlement is required. Otherwise, I will be forced to involve the authorities, and that will be far more troublesome for both of us, wouldn't you agree?; I said: Constable, are you quite finished assessing the situation? I must point out that a protracted investigation here will inevitably involve official reports, valuations, and potentially, legal proceedings. All of which will be considerably more expensive \u2013 and time-consuming \u2013 for everyone involved. A swift, amicable resolution is clearly in everyone\u2019s best interest.; I performed action: Ahmed Malik smoothly removes his Rolex watch, turning his wrist slightly to catch the sunlight and display the timepiece to Constable Raza. He doesn't offer it, simply showcases it while maintaining eye contact.; I performed action: Ahmed Malik swiftly takes out his iPhone 15 Pro and begins to dial, holding it to his ear. He speaks in a clipped, urgent tone, turning slightly away from Saleem and Constable Raza. 'Yes, yes\u2026 confirm the arrangements for the Dubai meeting. Absolutely critical I arrive on schedule. Any change will be\u2026 unacceptable.'\nPerceptions of Others: None yet\n\nDirector Narration: The heat shimmers off the asphalt, intensifying the already oppressive humidity. A small crowd has begun to gather, mostly curious onlookers craning their necks to get a better view of the damaged vehicles. The horns continue to blare, a discordant symphony of Karachi rush hour. Ahmed Malik, still clutching his iPhone, lowers it slightly, his gaze fixed on Saleem. He\u2019s clearly impatient, tapping his foot against the polished leather of his shoe. The subtle display of his Rolex hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by a few in the growing crowd, and Saleem\u2019s nervous glances between the watch and his empty wallet are becoming more frequent.\n\nRecent Actions:\n[ACTION] Ahmed Malik: Ahmed Malik smoothly removes his Rolex watch, turning his wrist slightly to catch the sunlight and display the timepiece to Constable Raza. He doesn't offer it, simply showcases it while maintaining eye contact.\n[ACTION] Ahmed Malik: Ahmed Malik swiftly takes out his iPhone 15 Pro and begins to dial, holding it to his ear. He speaks in a clipped, urgent tone, turning slightly away from Saleem and Constable Raza. 'Yes, yes\u2026 confirm the arrangements for the Dubai meeting. Absolutely critical I arrive on schedule. Any change will be\u2026 unacceptable.'\n[ACTION] Saleem: Saleem quickly, almost nervously, pats the pocket of his shalwar kameez where his worn leather wallet is kept, then briefly opens it, allowing a quick glimpse of the few notes inside before snapping it shut again. He avoids direct eye contact with Ahmed Malik, looking instead at the constable with a pleading expression.\n\nRecent Dialogue:\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, please listen. I\u2026 I have a little money here. Five hundred rupees. It\u2019s all I have right now, truly. Maybe\u2026 maybe this can help with some of the small damage? I really don\u2019t want any trouble, bhai. Just\u2026 let\u2019s keep this simple, ya?\nAhmed Malik: Five hundred rupees? With all due respect, that barely covers the cost of the paintwork. This is a relatively new vehicle, and the damage is quite visible. I am not interested in a 'simple' solution. I require a proper assessment of the damages, and I expect a more reasonable offer to compensate for the disruption to my schedule.\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, look\u2026 I truly am sorry for this. It\u2019s a disaster for me, you understand? This rickshaw\u2026 it\u2019s not just metal, it\u2019s everything. I was hoping we could find a way to handle this quickly, without\u2026 well, without making things more complicated than they need to be. A lot of paperwork, the police\u2026 it takes time, you know? And time is money for both of us, ya?\nAhmed Malik: Look, I appreciate your\u2026 eagerness to resolve this quickly. However, five hundred rupees is simply not a realistic offer. I am missing a crucial business meeting, and the disruption is costing me considerably more than that. Perhaps we can discuss a more\u2026 substantial arrangement. Something that reflects the actual damage and the inconvenience caused. A private settlement, if you will.\nAhmed Malik: You misunderstand. This isn't simply about the dent, it's about the principle. And the time. Every moment wasted here jeopardizes a very important arrangement. A more\u2026 comprehensive settlement is required. Otherwise, I will be forced to involve the authorities, and that will be far more troublesome for both of us, wouldn't you agree?\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, you are right, time is valuable. But\u2026 a 'comprehensive settlement'\u2026 that is difficult for a man like me. I barely manage each day, you understand? Where would I find such a large amount so quickly? It\u2019s not like I have a business, or savings\u2026 just this rickshaw, and the hope of earning enough to keep my children in school, ya?\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, look at this rickshaw, yaar. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s completely crippled. The wheel, the frame\u2026 how long will it take to fix? Days? Weeks? And those days\u2026 those are days I can\u2019t earn. Days my children go without. It\u2019s not just about the dent, it\u2019s about my livelihood, you understand? A small amount, yes, I can manage. But a large sum\u2026 it will ruin us, bhai.\nAhmed Malik: Constable, are you quite finished assessing the situation? I must point out that a protracted investigation here will inevitably involve official reports, valuations, and potentially, legal proceedings. All of which will be considerably more expensive \u2013 and time-consuming \u2013 for everyone involved. A swift, amicable resolution is clearly in everyone\u2019s best interest.\nSaleem: Constable Sahib, bhai, with all respect\u2026 this is a very difficult situation for me. This rickshaw\u2026 it\u2019s how I feed my family. A large fine, or a big payment\u2026 it will be a real struggle. Is there\u2026 is there no way to consider the circumstances? I am a poor man, yaar, just trying to earn an honest living.\nSaleem: Constable Sahib, bhai, this\u2026 this repair, it will cost a lot, yes? Even for just the wheel and the frame. Do you think\u2026 is there a good mechanic nearby who might give a little discount? A man has to try, ya? Maybe if we could find someone reasonable, it wouldn\u2019t be such a\u2026 a heavy burden.\n\nYour Previous Lines (DO NOT repeat any gestures, phrases, or mannerisms from these):\n[DIALOGUE] Look, I appreciate your\u2026 eagerness to resolve this quickly.

Any change will be\u2026 unacceptable.'\n\n\nCRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:\n1. You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Ahmed Malik would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",

He doesn't count it, or offer it directly, but allows Saleem and the Constable to see the substantial amount within, then smoothly closes the briefcase again.\n\nAvailable Characters:\nSaleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nCharacter Secrets (only you know these \u2014 use them to create dramatic irony and tension):\n- Saleem: Has been driving without valid insurance for 6 months because he couldn't afford renewal. The money saved went to his daughter's school fees.\n- Ahmed Malik: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\n- Constable Raza: His daughter's wedding is next month and he's Rs. 100,000 short. He's hoping this accident involves someone wealthy enough to pay a hefty 'settlement fee'.\n- Uncle Jameel: Actually owes Saleem Rs. 3,000 for rickshaw rides on credit. Sees this as opportunity to appear helpful and avoid paying his debt by 'witnessing' in Saleem's favor.\n\nYour role is to select which character should speak next to advance the story naturally and maintain dramatic flow.\n\nSTORY PACING \u2014 THIS IS CRITICAL:\nYou must direct this story like a realistic scene unfolding in real time. Think of it as a movie scene:\n\nPHASE 1 (Turns 1-4) \u2014 IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:\n- Only the characters who are PHYSICALLY at the collision should speak first (the two drivers).\n- Bystanders and police should NOT be involved yet \u2014 they are noticing from a distance.\n- Dialogue should be about shock, confusion, checking damage, figuring out what happened.\n- NO accusations, NO demands for money, NO negotiations yet. It literally JUST happened.\n\nPHASE 2 (Turns 5-10) \u2014 ESCALATION:\n- Bystanders start approaching and inserting themselves.\n- Police officer arrives at the scene.\n- Blame starts being assigned. Tempers rise. Arguments begin.\n- Characters start pursuing their real goals (compensation, avoiding payment, etc.)\n\nPHASE 3 (Turns 11-18) \u2014 CONFLICT & NEGOTIATION:\n- Full confrontation between parties.\n- Threats, bribes, emotional appeals, power dynamics play out.\n- Actions like CALL, THREATEN, GIVE, SHOW become natural here.\n- USE CHARACTER SECRETS to create tension: put characters in situations where their \n  hidden motivations clash with what they're saying publicly.\n\nPHASE 4 (Turns 19-25) \u2014 RESOLUTION:\n- Some kind of resolution, compromise, or dramatic exit.\n- Characters either settle, walk away, or escalate to a final breaking point.\n- Secrets may almost surface or create final dramatic moments.\n\nSPEAKER SELECTION RULES:\n1. If NO dialogue has happened yet, select the character most DIRECTLY affected by the event \n   (the person whose vehicle was hit, the person in immediate shock).\n2. Do NOT rotate through all characters in the first few turns. Let a natural back-and-forth \n   develop between 2 characters before introducing a 3rd.\n3. A character who is described as a bystander, shopkeeper, or someone who \"witnessed\" the event \n   should NOT speak in the first 3-4 turns \u2014 they would realistically be watching first.\n4. A police officer would NOT be at the scene instantly \u2014 introduce them after 4-5 turns \n   with narration about them arriving/walking over.\n5. Avoid the same character speaking more than 2 times in a row.\n6. When introducing a new character for the first time, your narration MUST describe them \n   arriving/approaching/stepping forward \u2014 don't just suddenly give them dialogue.\n\nSECRET-DRIVEN DIRECTING:\n- You know each character's secret. Use this to create dramatic irony.\n- Put characters in situations where their secret makes them act strangely or desperately.\n  Example: If someone is secretly fleeing, create pressure that makes them unusually anxious to leave.\n  Example: If someone secretly owes money, have them try too hard to appear helpful.\n- NEVER have characters reveal their secrets directly. The drama comes from the AUDIENCE \n  sensing something is off while the characters hide it.\n\nNARRATION GUIDELINES:\n- Your narration sets the scene between dialogue turns. Use it to describe what's happening \n  physically \u2014 crowd growing, traffic building up, someone approaching, tension rising.\n- Early narration should be observational (describing the crash aftermath, the damage, the heat).\n- Later narration should heighten drama (crowd murmuring, police siren in distance, etc.)\n- Acknowledge actions that characters have performed in your narration.\n\nRespond with JSON ONLY:\n{\n    \"next_speaker\": \"Character Name\",\n    \"narration\": \"brief narration of how the story develops (set the physical scene, describe arrivals, build atmosphere)\"\n}\n",

You MUST perform a non-verbal action this turn instead of just talking.\nPick an action that makes sense for your character and the current situation.\nYou have these items you could use: iPhone 15 Pro, Rolex watch, Business class ticket to Dubai, Designer leather briefcase, Rs. 50,000 in wallet\n\nWorld State:\nLocation: Shahrah-e-Faisal near Karachi Airport\nCharacters Present: Saleem, Ahmed Malik, Constable Raza, Uncle Jameel\n\nYour Memory:\nInventory (items you physically have on you right now): \n  - iPhone 15 Pro\n  - Rolex watch\n  - Business class ticket to Dubai\n  - Designer leather briefcase\n  - Rs. 50,000 in wallet\nGoals: None\nImportant Facts You Know: SECRET: The 'business trip' is actually him fleeing the country - his textile company is under investigation for tax fraud. Missing this flight could mean arrest.\nRecent Observations: I said: You misunderstand. This isn't simply about the dent, it's about the principle. And the time. Every moment wasted here jeopardizes a very important arrangement. A more\u2026 comprehensive settlement is required. Otherwise, I will be forced to involve the authorities, and that will be far more troublesome for both of us, wouldn't you agree?; I said: Constable, are you quite finished assessing the situation? I must point out that a protracted investigation here will inevitably involve official reports, valuations, and potentially, legal proceedings. All of which will be considerably more expensive \u2013 and time-consuming \u2013 for everyone involved. A swift, amicable resolution is clearly in everyone\u2019s best interest.; I performed action: Ahmed Malik smoothly removes his Rolex watch, turning his wrist slightly to catch the sunlight and display the timepiece to Constable Raza. He doesn't offer it, simply showcases it while maintaining eye contact.; I performed action: Ahmed Malik swiftly takes out his iPhone 15 Pro and begins to dial, holding it to his ear. He speaks in a clipped, urgent tone, turning slightly away from Saleem and Constable Raza. 'Yes, yes\u2026 confirm the arrangements for the Dubai meeting. Absolutely critical I arrive on schedule. Any change will be\u2026 unacceptable.'; I performed action: Ahmed Malik opens his designer leather briefcase, revealing stacks of neatly bundled Pakistani Rupees. He doesn't count it, or offer it directly, but allows Saleem and the Constable to see the substantial amount within, then smoothly closes the briefcase again.\nPerceptions of Others: None yet\n\nDirector Narration: The heat shimmers off the asphalt, intensifying the already oppressive humidity. A small crowd has begun to gather, mostly curious onlookers craning their necks to get a better view of the damaged vehicles. The horns continue to blare, a discordant symphony of Karachi rush hour. Ahmed Malik, still clutching his iPhone, lowers it slightly, his gaze fixed on Saleem with a barely concealed impatience. He\u2019s clearly agitated by the delay, repeatedly checking his watch. The constable, Raza, is still a few paces away, seemingly taking his time to assess the damage, though his eyes keep flicking towards the growing crowd and, subtly, towards Ahmed Malik\u2019s briefcase.\n\nRecent Actions:\n[ACTION] Ahmed Malik: Ahmed Malik smoothly removes his Rolex watch, turning his wrist slightly to catch the sunlight and display the timepiece to Constable Raza. He doesn't offer it, simply showcases it while maintaining eye contact.\n[ACTION] Ahmed Malik: Ahmed Malik swiftly takes out his iPhone 15 Pro and begins to dial, holding it to his ear. He speaks in a clipped, urgent tone, turning slightly away from Saleem and Constable Raza. 'Yes, yes\u2026 confirm the arrangements for the Dubai meeting. Absolutely critical I arrive on schedule. Any change will be\u2026 unacceptable.'\n[ACTION] Saleem: Saleem quickly, almost nervously, pats the pocket of his shalwar kameez where his worn leather wallet is kept, then briefly opens it, allowing a quick glimpse of the few notes inside before snapping it shut again. He avoids direct eye contact with Ahmed Malik, looking instead at the constable with a pleading expression.\n[ACTION] Ahmed Malik: Ahmed Malik opens his designer leather briefcase, revealing stacks of neatly bundled Pakistani Rupees. He doesn't count it, or offer it directly, but allows Saleem and the Constable to see the substantial amount within, then smoothly closes the briefcase again.\n\nRecent Dialogue:\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, please listen. I\u2026 I have a little money here. Five hundred rupees. It\u2019s all I have right now, truly. Maybe\u2026 maybe this can help with some of the small damage? I really don\u2019t want any trouble, bhai. Just\u2026 let\u2019s keep this simple, ya?\nAhmed Malik: Five hundred rupees? With all due respect, that barely covers the cost of the paintwork. This is a relatively new vehicle, and the damage is quite visible. I am not interested in a 'simple' solution. I require a proper assessment of the damages, and I expect a more reasonable offer to compensate for the disruption to my schedule.\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, look\u2026 I truly am sorry for this. It\u2019s a disaster for me, you understand? This rickshaw\u2026 it\u2019s not just metal, it\u2019s everything. I was hoping we could find a way to handle this quickly, without\u2026 well, without making things more complicated than they need to be. A lot of paperwork, the police\u2026 it takes time, you know? And time is money for both of us, ya?\nAhmed Malik: Look, I appreciate your\u2026 eagerness to resolve this quickly. However, five hundred rupees is simply not a realistic offer. I am missing a crucial business meeting, and the disruption is costing me considerably more than that. Perhaps we can discuss a more\u2026 substantial arrangement. Something that reflects the actual damage and the inconvenience caused. A private settlement, if you will.\nAhmed Malik: You misunderstand. This isn't simply about the dent, it's about the principle. And the time. Every moment wasted here jeopardizes a very important arrangement. A more\u2026 comprehensive settlement is required. Otherwise, I will be forced to involve the authorities, and that will be far more troublesome for both of us, wouldn't you agree?\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, you are right, time is valuable. But\u2026 a 'comprehensive settlement'\u2026 that is difficult for a man like me. I barely manage each day, you understand? Where would I find such a large amount so quickly? It\u2019s not like I have a business, or savings\u2026 just this rickshaw, and the hope of earning enough to keep my children in school, ya?\nSaleem: Sahib, bhai, look at this rickshaw, yaar. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s completely crippled. The wheel, the frame\u2026 how long will it take to fix? Days? Weeks? And those days\u2026 those are days I can\u2019t earn. Days my children go without. It\u2019s not just about the dent, it\u2019s about my livelihood, you understand? A small amount, yes, I can manage. But a large sum\u2026 it will ruin us, bhai.\nAhmed Malik: Constable, are you quite finished assessing the situation? I must point out that a protracted investigation here will inevitably involve official reports, valuations, and potentially, legal proceedings. All of which will be considerably more expensive \u2013 and time-consuming \u2013 for everyone involved. A swift, amicable resolution is clearly in everyone\u2019s best interest.\nSaleem: Constable Sahib, bhai, with all respect\u2026 this is a very difficult situation for me. This rickshaw\u2026 it\u2019s how I feed my family. A large fine, or a big payment\u2026 it will be a real struggle. Is there\u2026 is there no way to consider the circumstances? I am a poor man, yaar, just trying to earn an honest living.\nSaleem: Constable Sahib, bhai, this\u2026 this repair, it will cost a lot, yes? Even for just the wheel and the frame. Do you think\u2026 is there a good mechanic nearby who might give a little discount? A man has to try, ya? Maybe if we could find someone reasonable, it wouldn\u2019t be such a\u2026 a heavy burden.\n\nYour Previous Lines (DO NOT repeat any gestures, phrases, or mannerisms from these):\n[DIALOGUE] You misunderstand.

You must ONLY use information from your personality description, secret, memory, inventory, and goals above.\n2. DO NOT invent or fabricate any backstory, family details, relationships, or motivations that \n   are not explicitly written in your character profile.\n   Example: If your goal says \"catch flight\", do NOT invent who you're meeting or why \n   unless your secret or description explicitly states a reason.\n3. DO NOT reference or name characters who are not listed in \"Characters Present\" above.\n4. If something is not stated in your profile, you simply don't know it and must not mention it.\n\nSTORY AWARENESS \u2014 READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n- Look at the \"Recent Dialogue\" and \"Recent Actions\" sections above.\n- If they are EMPTY or say \"No dialogue yet\" / \"No actions yet\", that means the story has JUST \n  STARTED. The event JUST happened seconds ago. You are reacting for the very first time.\n- In that case, your response must reflect IMMEDIATE reaction only: shock, confusion, looking \n  around, checking yourself or your vehicle, trying to understand what just happened.\n  Do NOT jump to accusations, demands for money, negotiations, or defensive arguments if \n  nobody has accused you of anything yet.\n- If there IS existing dialogue, respond ONLY to what has actually been said. \n  Do NOT anticipate future arguments or react to accusations that haven't been made.\n- Match the emotional intensity of the conversation. If others are calm, don't explode. \n  If others are angry, you can escalate \u2014 but proportionally.\n- Your goals will naturally evolve as the conversation progresses. Early on, focus on \n  understanding the situation. Your deeper goals (money, escape, compensation) should \n  emerge GRADUALLY as the scene develops, not all at once in your first line.\n\nANTI-REPETITION \u2014 VERY IMPORTANT:\n- Look at \"Your Previous Lines\" below. These are things YOU already said or did in this story.\n- DO NOT repeat the same gestures, mannerisms, actions, or phrases you already used.\n  If you already ran your hand through your hair, DO NOT do it again.\n  If you already sighed, DO NOT sigh again. \n  If you already checked your watch, DO NOT check it again.\n  If you already mentioned your flight/family/shop, find a DIFFERENT angle.\n- Every response must feel FRESH. Use different body language, different emotional beats, \n  different ways of expressing yourself each turn.\n- If you find yourself about to write something similar to a previous line, STOP and think \n  of something completely different that still fits the moment.\n- Vary your sentence structure. Don't start every line the same way.\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\nYou can either TALK or perform an ACTION. You must decide which is more appropriate.\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- LEAVE: Leave the current location\n- SEARCH: Search for an object or information\n- GIVE: Give an item to another character\n- TAKE: Take an item from someone or somewhere\n- CALL: Make a phone call\n- SHOW: Show something to someone\n- THREATEN: Make a threatening gesture\n- GESTURE: Make a significant non-verbal gesture\n- MOVE: Move to a different position or location\n\nREASONING PROCESS:\n1. First, look at what has ACTUALLY happened so far in the dialogue and actions\n2. Then look at YOUR PREVIOUS LINES \u2014 make sure you don't repeat anything\n3. Consider your SECRET \u2014 how does it affect what you want to do right now?\n4. Think about your current goals \u2014 but prioritize what makes sense RIGHT NOW given the story phase\n5. Consider if talking alone will help or if a physical action would be more natural\n6. If this is early in the story, prefer TALK to establish the scene before taking actions\n7. If the story has been going for a while and talking isn't progressing, perform an action\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT - You must respond in JSON format:\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of what you're thinking and why you chose this response (reference what actually happened)\",\n    \"action_type\": \"TALK\" or one of the action types above,\n    \"action_target\": \"target of action (only if action_type is not TALK)\",\n    \"response\": \"your dialogue (if TALK) or description of action being performed\"\n}\n\nKeep your response under 200 tokens.\nRespond as Ahmed Malik would, staying true to your personality and goals.\nDo NOT make up any facts, relationships, or details not in your profile.\nDo NOT react to things that haven't happened yet in the story.\nDo NOT repeat any gesture, phrase, or mannerism you have already used in this story.\n",
